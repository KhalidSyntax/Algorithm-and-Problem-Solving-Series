# 🧮 Algorithm and Problem Solving – Level 1 & 2

This repository contains beginner to intermediate level problem-solving tasks using C++.  
It is part of a structured course focused on developing logical thinking, clean code, and modular design through C++.

---

## 📘 Level 1 – Basics

### 🔍 Summary

- Focuses on building a strong foundation in programming logic and C++ basics.
- All problems are solved using **functions** to improve structure and clarity.
- Covers key concepts: input/output, conditions, loops, arithmetic operations, and variables.
- Reinforces different loop structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- Designed to develop step-by-step logical thinking and error-free coding.

### 🛠 Language
- C++

### 📁 Structure
Each `.cpp` file solves a specific problem and is named accordingly (e.g., `Problem-1.cpp`, `Problem-2.cpp`, ...).

## 📗 Level 2 – Numbers and Arrays

### 🔍 Summary

- Builds upon Level 1 with new exercises focused on numbers and arrays.
- Emphasizes the use of **modular functions**, **enumerations**, and **arrays**.
- Covers critical topics:
  - Perfect numbers  
  - Palindromes  
  - Digit frequency  
  - Reversing numbers  
  - Sum/average/min/max of arrays  
  - Prime number operations  
  - Random key/password generation  
  - Array copying/shuffling
- Introduces real-world patterns and simulations like encryption and password guessing.
- Aims to enhance **efficiency**, **clarity**, and **code reusability**.

### 🛠 Language
- C++

### 📁 Structure
Each `.cpp` file solves a specific problem and is named accordingly (e.g., `Problem-11.cpp`, `Problem-12.cpp`, ..., `Problem-42.cpp`).

## ✅ Notes

- Code is written using **standard C++** and compiled using common compilers like `g++` or **Visual Studio**.
- Functions are used extensively to divide problems into logical units.
- Enumerations (`enum`) are used to improve code readability in decision-making scenarios.

# Algorithm and Problem Solving – Level 1

This repository contains beginner-level problem-solving tasks using C++.  
It is the first level of a structured course that focuses on writing clean, modular, and logical code using functions.

## 🔍 Summary

- Focuses on building a strong foundation in programming logic and C++ basics.
- All problems are solved using **functions** to improve structure and clarity.
- Covers key concepts: input/output, conditions, loops, arithmetic operations, and variables.
- Reinforces different loop structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- Designed to develop step-by-step logical thinking and error-free coding.

## 🛠 Language
- C++

## 📁 Structure
Each `.cpp` file solves a specific problem and is named accordingly (e.g., `Problem-1.cpp`, `Problem-2.cpp`, ...).
